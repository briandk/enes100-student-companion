## Newton's First Law

inertia

:   The tendency of an object to remain in motion (if it's already in motion) or to remain at rest (if it's already at rest

## Newton's Second Law

We know from **Newton's Second Law of Motion** that the net force exerted on a point is the vector sum of all forces on that point:

$$
\vec{F}_\textrm{net} = m \vec{a}
$$

## Newton's Third Law

Newton's Third Law states that for every **action**, there is an equal and opposite **reaction**.
