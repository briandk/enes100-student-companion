# Over Sand Vehicle (OSV) Product Specifications

## Structure Requirements

1.  The OSV mass (or total mass of OSV fleet) must be between 0 and 2.5 kg.

2.  The OSV body and propulsion system (or entire OSV fleet if using more than one OSV) must fit within a 300 x 300 mm footprint.[^osv-product-specifications-1]

3.  Any kit or pre-built assemblies may each perform functions from **at most** two of the following categories:

    1.  motors / gearmotors;
    2.  wheels / tires / treads;
    3.  chassis;
    4.  suspension;
    5.  transmission / differential / drivetrain;
    6.  motor controllers.[^osv-product-specifications-2]

[^osv-product-specifications-1]: Arms or probes do not need to fit within this footprint.

[^osv-product-specifications-2]: A kit is defined as a set of components sold by the same manufacturer or vendor that have been designed to seamlessly integrate together.

## Power Requirements

1.  The use of lithium based or lead acid battery technologies are prohibited.

2.  The use of combustion engines are prohibited.

3.  The OSV(s) must be able to run all systems at full power for at least 10 minutes without replenishing/recharging its energy source.

## Performance Requirements

1.  The OSV(s) must be able to complete all objectives for one of the missions described in the [*Over Sand Vehicle Project Overview*](#osv-project-overview) in under 5 minutes.

## Communication Requirements

1.  The OSV(s) must be able to transmit and receive wifi communications using the ESP8266 WiFi Communication Module.

    2.  There must be a Aruco tracking marker of size between 50x50mm and 100x100mm with a 15 mm white border placed on the top of the vehicle.[^osv-product-specifications-3]

[^osv-product-specifications-3]: The only exception to the switch requirement is for single cell 9v batteries if used to power the microcontroller.

## Control and Navigation Requirements

1.  The OSV(s) must be controlled by an Arduino compatible microcontroller.

2.  The OSV(s) operation during testing must be autonomous.\[\^osv-product-specifications-4\]

3.  The OSV(s) must be able to navigate to a specified point within Â± 250 mm.

## Safety Requirements

1.  All batteries must be operated with a mechanical kill switch at all times. Batteries that have exposed leads for recharging are also required to be equipped with male/female Tamiya (or similar) connectors at all times in order to avoid dangerous shorting.[^osv-product-specifications-4]

2.  No exposed pins, nails, razor blades, or other dangerously sharp objects are permitted on the OSV(s).

3.  Any part of the OSV(s) that is intended to come in close proximity to a flame must be non-flammable.

4.  No materials that leave a residue may be used to extinguish the flames.

[^osv-product-specifications-4]: The only exception to the switch requirement is for single cell 9v batteries if used to power the microcontroller.

## Cost Requirements

1.  Total as-built replacement cost of the OSV(s) must be less than \$320.

2.  Teams must present a Bill of Materials (BOM) that includes the Fair Market Value (FMV) for each component present on the competition vehicle.\[\^osv-product-specifications-6\]

3.  All 3D printed, laser cut, and CNC milled parts on your OSV(s) must be included in your BOM.

    1.  PLA parts printed in the ENES 100 laboratories cost \$0.10 per gram. CNC milling authorized through ENES 100 costs \$25 per hour.\[\^osv-product-specifications-7\]

    2.  Birch plywood sheets laser cut in the ENES 100 laboratories cost \$3.00 per sheet.\[\^osv-product-specifications-8\]

    3.  Acrylic sheets laser cut in the ENES 100 laboratories cost \$5.00 per sheet.\[\^osv-product-specifications-9\]

    4.  CNC milling costs \$25 per hour.
