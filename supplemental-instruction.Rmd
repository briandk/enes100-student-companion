# (PART) Supplemental Instruction {.unnumbered}

# Introduction {#import-intro}

Creating a successful robot requires a knowledge of three core domains:

-   Mechanics
-   Electronics
-   Programming

## Mechanics

We know from **Newton's Second Law of Motion** that the net force exerted on a point is the vector sum of all forces on that point:

$$
\vec{{F_{\textrm{net}}}} = m \vec{a}
$$

## Electronics

**Ohm's Law** gives us the relationship between current $I$, voltage $V$, and resistance $R$ as:

$$
V = IR
$$

We can also express the **power** $P$ as a the product of voltage and current:

$$
P = IV
$$

## Programming

When we first run our Arduino, we do the now-traditional programming trick of having it say hello to the world:

```{c arduino-setup, eval=FALSE}
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}
```
